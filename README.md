# Academic Projects in Java

Welcome to the repository for my academic prosits implemented in Java. This repository contains various prosits that I have worked on during my academic journey using Java. Each prosit is designed to solve simple problems and demonstrate my understanding of Java programming and algorithms.

# NB

You can find the prosits instructions under this repository path : src/tn/esprit/gestionZoo/Prosits
